"2/8 Bd Pasteur, 95210 Saint-Gratien, France",ibis budget Saint-Gratien Enghien-les-Bains,"50 euro a day, I'm gonna start with this.

Have you ever stayed in a hotel room and thought, wow this is dirty? Think again, this room was the dirtiest one I've seen so far.

Im super allergic and couldn't stop sneezing untill I took an antihistamine.

The showerhead holder is broken and I think this is made on purpose so people don't take long showers, as another guest told me theirs was broken too.

Allergics like me should think twice before booking, if not... It's a cheap hotel and just a train away from Paris for just 4.05 euros. Nice restaurants around and a dominos place right next to it."
"2/8 Bd Pasteur, 95210 Saint-Gratien, France",ibis budget Saint-Gratien Enghien-les-Bains,A budget hotel is high praise for this dilapidated building. The decor is worn with mould and damp in places. If you are travelling by car you will find more comfort sleeping in the car. The air conditioning is as effective as someone blowing warm air in your face with their mouth. There is no sink in the toilet - the sink is in the room. The toilet area is very very small.
"2/8 Bd Pasteur, 95210 Saint-Gratien, France",ibis budget Saint-Gratien Enghien-les-Bains,"The worst hotel I've seen in my life.  The receptionist has no respect for customers or tact in speaking. He was very disrespectful.  Even if the customer is wrong, there must be respect, because we did not stay for free.  I do not recommend this hotel at all, in addition to the lack of cleanliness in the place."
"2/8 Bd Pasteur, 95210 Saint-Gratien, France",ibis budget Saint-Gratien Enghien-les-Bains,"I'm giving this hotel a two star for location only as it is a five min walk to a regional train station. Everything about the place was either dirty or in disrepair. Ibis Budget, you can do better, even at the low room cost to guests."
"2/8 Bd Pasteur, 95210 Saint-Gratien, France",ibis budget Saint-Gratien Enghien-les-Bains,"Worst hotel I have visited in a long time!!!!

Everything and incredibly dirty and in poor condition. Partly mold in the room. I can not understand any of the 5 star ratings of other guests."
"53 Av. des Nations ZA Paris Nord 2, 93420 Villepinte, France",KYRIAD ROISSY VILLEPINTE - Parc des Expositions,"I was in this hotel wit my Family
I didnt like it!!!
1. The hotel smell so bad
2. The Elevator smell so bad
3. The Room is tidy but smell so bad
4. I will never come back here,while we go out the cleaner come in  our room and clean our room, thats not normal!!!! This hotel is not to be trusted
Never again!!!
Thats why its so cheapü§•
Worst hotel we went to"
"53 Av. des Nations ZA Paris Nord 2, 93420 Villepinte, France",KYRIAD ROISSY VILLEPINTE - Parc des Expositions,"This place must pay a company to give it good reviews!  The elevators are filthy, the carpet in the room was filthy. The room itself was dirty, The walls were dirty. The entire hotel is in need of an update!
I was told when I checked in, it's a 4 star hotel üò´. I booked the room according to reviews as well!!"
"53 Av. des Nations ZA Paris Nord 2, 93420 Villepinte, France",KYRIAD ROISSY VILLEPINTE - Parc des Expositions,"The hotel is in a very poor condition and the service is really bad.
The bathroom's sink was really dirty, even a piece of hair was there and the tv's remote was missing a battery.
even if it has a good location, it's not worth it.
don't believe any of the positive reviews, it's all a scam.
I'm amazed that this garbage has 2 stars, one star is too generous."
"53 Av. des Nations ZA Paris Nord 2, 93420 Villepinte, France",KYRIAD ROISSY VILLEPINTE - Parc des Expositions,"For a night in Paris, the price is unbeatable. So if you are looking for a cheap stay for a night to catch an early morning flight, this is perfect!

I mean, with such a low price for a separate room near CDG airport, there is very little you can complain about.

However, be prepared; there is no supermarkets/ food shop within walk-able distance. It's kind located in an industrial/ office area."
"53 Av. des Nations ZA Paris Nord 2, 93420 Villepinte, France",KYRIAD ROISSY VILLEPINTE - Parc des Expositions,Good place to stay nearby Paris. Easy to reach here by Metro from Gare Du Nord.
"2, Rue Du Mur Du Parc, Centre Commercial Carrefour, Rn 13, 78240 Chambourcy, France",ibis budget Chambourcy Saint-Germain,"This is the most horrendous hotel I've ever stayed at. We walked into our room on the ground floor and it was like walking into a smoking room. We stayed only one night but it stank so much of cigarettes all our clothes and bags were stinking by the time we left. The room was a dingy mint green and had mould in parts. When you had a shower all the water came out and leaked all over the floor. The room was full of mosquitoes, we are both covered in bites, I've even got one on my forehead which has never happened in my life. I see from the other reviews that we are not the only people with this issue, and it was the last thing I expect in October. It made it really hard to sleep as every time we started falling into a sleep there was a buzzing around our heads. I've stayed in two other budget IBIS hotels, they were fine. This is an awful place, I could not wait to escape."
"2, Rue Du Mur Du Parc, Centre Commercial Carrefour, Rn 13, 78240 Chambourcy, France",ibis budget Chambourcy Saint-Germain,"Not bad quality price for the area, but the hotel was under renovation and it smelled a lot of fresh paint. The receptionist was very friendly."
"2, Rue Du Mur Du Parc, Centre Commercial Carrefour, Rn 13, 78240 Chambourcy, France",ibis budget Chambourcy Saint-Germain,"Needs an update, very old and outdated"
"2, Rue Du Mur Du Parc, Centre Commercial Carrefour, Rn 13, 78240 Chambourcy, France",ibis budget Chambourcy Saint-Germain,Too hot no AC a lot of moustique ü¶ü the only good thing free parking and front desk was professional.
"2, Rue Du Mur Du Parc, Centre Commercial Carrefour, Rn 13, 78240 Chambourcy, France",ibis budget Chambourcy Saint-Germain,Excellent
"L'Or√©e Du Val De Marne, Rue du Noyer-Saint-Germain, 94440 Santeny, France",ibis budget Santeny,"Loose window, either way you are freezing or sweating during sleeping, cold water for the first 5 minutes of water running, hotel service walking into room without your permission"
"L'Or√©e Du Val De Marne, Rue du Noyer-Saint-Germain, 94440 Santeny, France",ibis budget Santeny,"Nice clean, simple hotel. Staff very friendly and efficient. Recommended."
"L'Or√©e Du Val De Marne, Rue du Noyer-Saint-Germain, 94440 Santeny, France",ibis budget Santeny,Top
"L'Or√©e Du Val De Marne, Rue du Noyer-Saint-Germain, 94440 Santeny, France",ibis budget Santeny,Too expensive for the quality and services offered.
"L'Or√©e Du Val De Marne, Rue du Noyer-Saint-Germain, 94440 Santeny, France",ibis budget Santeny,"Good, nice meal and service is okay"
"Zac La Garenne, 14 All. du Plateau, 93250 Villemomble, France",ibis budget Villemomble,"Super far from Paris (tourist area).
Rooms are tiny like smaller than the IKEA showroom in Red Hook, Brooklyn, NY. Do no recommend. Felt more like a prison setting than a hotel. Ended up getting something closer to Paris and bigger. It was truly a waste of money."
"Zac La Garenne, 14 All. du Plateau, 93250 Villemomble, France",ibis budget Villemomble,"The Place for this thing is the most terible one and the false advertising for being few minutes away from center which is completely false. The staff isn't very good either (if you get the man in the evening I think hes tired) but otherd are pretty good but they are asking for some random city tax thing which I have no Idea what it is or what it means.
Rooms aren't good either but its atleast better than the staff and the location of this thing.
Breakfast Is Good I like it
Final Rating: 2,5 stars ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ"
"Zac La Garenne, 14 All. du Plateau, 93250 Villemomble, France",ibis budget Villemomble,"This place is good to stay for 1 or 2 days max. We needed a place to sleep, and it was nighttime already. We called beforehand if there was a room available for the night. The reception welcomed us very friendly when when we arrived."
"Zac La Garenne, 14 All. du Plateau, 93250 Villemomble, France",ibis budget Villemomble,"The receptionists Vania and zakria  are so friendly and helpful, willing to help for any inquiries. I asked them for iron and adapter and I got them in a second. They will treated respect and kindness like 7 stars hotel. The two best receptionists ever."
"Zac La Garenne, 14 All. du Plateau, 93250 Villemomble, France",ibis budget Villemomble,Parking space is too small i.e. the space allotted for a single vehicle is not of a comfortable width. Everything else is okay/good from the pov of a budget place.
"10 Av. Ettore Bugatti, 91310 Linas, France",Comfort Hotel Linas - Montlhery,I was not expecting much from this hotel however the food was delicious and the staff were extremely well mannered and very pleasant. üëç
"10 Av. Ettore Bugatti, 91310 Linas, France",Comfort Hotel Linas - Montlhery,"Comfy bed and pillows, always very clean (already stayed 4-5 times), super fast internet and free parking. Modest rooms but great value for the money.

My only (minor) complaints were that in the room that we stayed in, the shower door could easily leak to the floor and that it was a bit hard to get the space heater to work."
"10 Av. Ettore Bugatti, 91310 Linas, France",Comfort Hotel Linas - Montlhery,"Too far from Paris. But staff were great, and saved us a lot of trouble by warning us at the airport we were flying out of would require getting there about 5 hours early not just 3 (strikes at the airport or something; the airport was a nightmare!)"
"10 Av. Ettore Bugatti, 91310 Linas, France",Comfort Hotel Linas - Montlhery,Very helpful over chat and answered everything I wanted to know before booking. Thought I was going to be late getting here but that wasn't a problem at all. Room is just what I needed after a very long drive. Room is nothing special but its a bed and clean and looking forward to breakfast. Payed more for a room and had a lot worse. Receptionist is pleasant too.
"10 Av. Ettore Bugatti, 91310 Linas, France",Comfort Hotel Linas - Montlhery,"The hotel was welcoming and the public areas were well presented. Our room was clean and comfortable and provided with kettle and tea/coffee. Throughout our 10 day stay all staff were courteous and efficient. A special mention and praise must be made of the management and reception staff who were very approachable, friendly, attentive and helpfully  in all aspects and made our stay as pleasant as possible, which was much appreciated - a big Thank You."
"6 Rue Andr√© Citro√´n, 94510 La Queue-en-Brie, France",B&B HOTEL La Queue-En-Brie,"Super budget hotel to stay for a few nights, convenient in and out, and has a keyless bedroom with digital numbers to get in.

If arriving late, you can use your booking number to get in; very simple.

Excellent and safe car park. Nice restaurant across the parking lot, doesn't belong to the hotel.

Breakfast in the morning is typically French, croissants, juice and coffee.

A very safe place to stay, 30 kilometres from Paris.
I was in my car, so I didn't know the transport connection to and from Paris.

Excellent WI-FI connection and super helpful staff with the English language barrier.

The bedroom is immaculate and comfortable.

My own rating of the Hotel is 5/5"
"6 Rue Andr√© Citro√´n, 94510 La Queue-en-Brie, France",B&B HOTEL La Queue-En-Brie,"I had the worst experience, dirty smelly room, a leaking pipe under the sink. The staff tried to fix the pipe  after i complained but 5 min later it was the same again and by then the reception was closed and we were stuck there. I complained again the morning after. We had booked 2 nights but refused to stay more than one int that place, i demanded a compensation for the night in unacceptable conditions and said i would even pay for the night i decided to skip, but they denied any compensation and said they could only give us another room. All of this in conversation with staff that understands almost no english and will answer only in french which makes for an extremely frustrating pointless conversation as I don‚Äôt speak french. Hotel staff needs to be able to communicate in english, period. I have contacted the hotel through the email provided by the receptionist and so far no answer. Absolutely disgusting."
"6 Rue Andr√© Citro√´n, 94510 La Queue-en-Brie, France",B&B HOTEL La Queue-En-Brie,"Hi, this hotel does not have fridge or cartel or even drawers just good bed and decent bathroom with free car parking compared to other prices it‚Äôs acceptable."
"6 Rue Andr√© Citro√´n, 94510 La Queue-en-Brie, France",B&B HOTEL La Queue-En-Brie,"Simple, functional, breakfast was good, hotel could use a refresher, nice restaurant next door."
"6 Rue Andr√© Citro√´n, 94510 La Queue-en-Brie, France",B&B HOTEL La Queue-En-Brie,Great budget room for the price. Everything is clean. Comfortable enough beds. Would stay again if necessary for traveling through.
"Centre De Vie Immoparc, N10, 78190 Trappes, France",ibis budget Versailles Trappes,"As expected for a Ibis. I like Accor hotels and have preference for them. Fair price and good location. I had a problem during my stay but it was resolved and this shows customer care. Problems can happen on any hotel, good to see Ibis working to resolve it. Congratulations."
"Centre De Vie Immoparc, N10, 78190 Trappes, France",ibis budget Versailles Trappes,"By far the worst IBIS budget hotel I've been to, and probably one of the worst overall.
Very passive personnel and none of them speaking a word in English."
"Centre De Vie Immoparc, N10, 78190 Trappes, France",ibis budget Versailles Trappes,"Very rude member of staff with glasses in the morning, wasnt told breakfast times during check in when we paid for it so we ended up missing it by 10 minutes. Tiny rooms rubbish shower noisey due to the main road. Single thin pillow to sleep on. Honestly the best thing the hotels got going for itself is a free car park and the road out of it. Wouldnt recommend"
"Centre De Vie Immoparc, N10, 78190 Trappes, France",ibis budget Versailles Trappes,"This is Ibis budget so no there's no jacuzzi, it's a basic room with a TV, the shower was great however, better than some of the expensive hotels I've stopped in. There's parking right outside and it's gated off in the evening, there's a restaurant just next door and for a small extra you can have breakfast from 6.30am onwards, if you need a stopover it's perfect really. The guy running it when we stopped was really helpful and informative a credit to the place."
"Centre De Vie Immoparc, N10, 78190 Trappes, France",ibis budget Versailles Trappes,Noisy guests in corridor on first floor. Regulars I guess. No wonder car park is empty. Previous reviews accurate. Shabby interior. Stayed in better F1's. Possibly the worst Ibis Budget I've stayed at.
"Rn, 16 La Redoute du Moulin, 95440 √âcouen, France",H√¥tel Kyriad Paris Nord - Ecouen,"Stayed for two nights whilst working in snd around Paris, the hotel is secure (if you are checking in late ask for the gate entry code before you arrive). Its a little old and dated but it was good value for money. The reception was very helpful, attentive and welcoming. I will certainly use again when I‚Äôm back in Paris
Thank you again üòÑ"
"Rn, 16 La Redoute du Moulin, 95440 √âcouen, France",H√¥tel Kyriad Paris Nord - Ecouen,"They felt dirty, wet and the neighbours could be heard really well. The atmosphere was uneasy during the stay. It did not feel safe what so ever, the doors were sqeecking, rattling and it felt uneasy at all times. A lot of spiders in the room and some ants. Was hoping for something better after reading the reviews, but it is pretty much the truth and not so good."
"Rn, 16 La Redoute du Moulin, 95440 √âcouen, France",H√¥tel Kyriad Paris Nord - Ecouen,"Very secure, like a US motel very basic. Food was really nice and the staff were very friendly."
"Rn, 16 La Redoute du Moulin, 95440 √âcouen, France",H√¥tel Kyriad Paris Nord - Ecouen,"Bad experience .I‚Äôll explain:
Staff helpful.
Room smelling bad
Mold in the bathroom
Everything is old an yellow
Staff are trying there best to keep the place running
Doggy place over all
Not recomended"
"Rn, 16 La Redoute du Moulin, 95440 √âcouen, France",H√¥tel Kyriad Paris Nord - Ecouen,"Nice and clean but their prices online don't usually reflect the real deal.
Nice little hotel though."
"52 Av. du Chemin de Mesly, 94000 Cr√©teil, France",Hotel Campanile Creteil,"We stayed two nights. The hotel is located in the 6th arrondissement of Paris and is 20 stops or 40 minutes from the Arc de Triomphe metro. The hotel is close to the motorway and metro line, but the soundproofing is excellent so sleeping was not a problem. There is a large shopping centre next to the hotel with everything you could possibly need. McDonald ir near.
The room is tiny, it's good that there is a kettle and a hairdryer but the shower is so cramped that you can't even put your hands in it. The bed was comfortable and my back didn't hurt in the mornings.
Breakfast was a croissant, several types of muffins, boiled ham or ham and baguette. Nothing else except jam and jam. In addition, people eat quickly and replenish food slowly, or you come in and there are no plates, forks or spoons, and then you have to ask for them to be brought in."
"52 Av. du Chemin de Mesly, 94000 Cr√©teil, France",Hotel Campanile Creteil,"Small rooms but clean, 8 min to metro, cleaning lady ""forgot"" to clean our room, breakfast buffet wasn't filled when we came to dining room so we had to eat only crossaints with ham and cheese. Receptionist at the evening was kind."
"52 Av. du Chemin de Mesly, 94000 Cr√©teil, France",Hotel Campanile Creteil,"Easily accessible,i spent just a night there but it was good thou.. had a Great conversation with the members of the personnel..
I do recommend"
"52 Av. du Chemin de Mesly, 94000 Cr√©teil, France",Hotel Campanile Creteil,Adequate room with third unused bed. Room had air conditioning and TV. Bed was good and room was clean. Looked as if it had had a refurbishment with new carpet. Okay size  bathroom with shower. Parking available for free... breakfast available on site (we didn't use) or adjacent McDonald's. Internet was good. Easy to drive or get nearby public transport into Paris... the centre of Paris was about 30 minutes in the evening by car (45 minutes at lunchtime). Felt safe in the area. Staff on desk and cleaning staff were polite. Okay for a short two or three day stay ... particularly if you have a car. We would use again.
"52 Av. du Chemin de Mesly, 94000 Cr√©teil, France",Hotel Campanile Creteil,"PATRON BE WARE!

This hotel scams! They are WICKED! They charged my credit card‚Äînot entirely sure how they got my card information‚Äîwhen booking it did not prompt for the card because the only option was to pay at the hotel. I canceled my booking through the SAME means I reserved it within AMPLE time. On the fourth/fifth day of the stay I WOULD have had with them‚Äîif not canceled, I saw that this hotel charged my card for the ENTIRE stay‚Äîto include the breakfast buffet‚Ä¶ despite the fact that I did NOT EVER step foot near this place let alone stay on the premises even 1 night. And‚Ä¶ And‚Ä¶ after I disputed this fraudulent charge with my card company this hotel provided a phony invoice to my credit card company for a stay that was NOT had by me‚Äîroom number and all! It‚Äôs astonishing how it‚Äôs possible for this hotel to RECEIVE a reservation but NOT receive/acknowledge a cancellation made through the same means. I called hotel management to dispute this personally and they very were curt in denying me a resolution. Do yourself a favor and just DO NOT deal with this hotel AT ALL or EVER. Their way of operating is purely WICKED and does NOT serve the customer.

Reader‚Ä¶ if you need receipts as proof of this review, I‚Äôll be glad to show them to you‚Äîjust reach out. I‚Äôm trying to save many patrons from this wicked nightmare."
"10 Av. des Tuileries, 91350 Grigny, France",ibis budget Grigny Centre,"I only learned of this hotel through Accor Live Limitless which I do not think I will be utilizing again. So I will start by saying this hotel is cheap and that‚Äôs exactly what it is and nothing more as it is in a very poor city. It‚Äôs really hard to find any positives for this hotel. Before getting to this hotel, I tried contacting via both phone & email to see if I could extend my reservation for 3 (triple person room w/ 1 double bed, plus 1 bunk bed) and never got a response. The one time someone finally spoke with me on the phone, they told me the internet wasn‚Äôt working so they couldn‚Äôt find my reservation details. We arrived and the area of our hotel looked a bit sketchy but no worries I didn‚Äôt want to judge a book by it‚Äôs cover. The lady at the front desk checked-us in and told us sadly she couldn‚Äôt extend our stay. She gave us a room key and gave us a small fan for our room (btw no A/C in this hotel). The room key didn‚Äôt even work until we went back downstairs to ask for her to give us a new key. There were only a total of 3 outlets in the room and the fan they gave us was insufficient until I requested a 2nd fan. That fan however was already broken and didn‚Äôt work properly when plugged in. The bunk bed had a dirty blanket and sheets so we didn‚Äôt use it and ended up sharing the double bed all 3 of us. The chair for the room was a small stool with no back rest. The toilet was very difficult to flush and the door to the room very difficult to close. The 2nd day of our stay, there was no water available; I don‚Äôt know why the water was taken. When we complained, we were told it would return later that evening. The sink broke on the 3rd & last day of our stay, as in the sink pipe became detached from another one of the pipes underneath so water spilled everywhere. Luckily, I was able to attach it back. The only positive was it was walking distance from RER station Grigny ctr., and the wifi had good connection. Also the Romanian cleaning staff lady was kind enough and offered us more towels and toilet paper for our room. Honestly, I was glad to escape this hotel and managed to run off to another hotel which was much better suited for all of us and even closer to the city center. Also I should add, we all spoke french so communication was not an issue so I don‚Äôt know how the stay would have been for people who do not speak/understand french. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel to anybody back home (in US) planning their trip to France."
"10 Av. des Tuileries, 91350 Grigny, France",ibis budget Grigny Centre,"I booked breakfast for myself and my daughter online but I ended up paying extra money for breakfast, the rooms were hot and I was giving a broken fan"
"10 Av. des Tuileries, 91350 Grigny, France",ibis budget Grigny Centre,"The cockroaches were friendly enough, but having to listen to the creaky elevator and people arguing in the hallways at all hours was a bit much. The room was beyond basic and the mattress was really just a thick blanket over wood. There isn't even anything worth looking out the window at. At best, it's close to the train."

"10 Av. des Tuileries, 91350 Grigny, France",ibis budget Grigny Centre,"Very bad experience I ve booked from the 30 September to 02 October. I came on the 30 September I ve been told the hotel is full   and they did not accommodate us my husband and I. We were  forced to go to pay for another room to kyriad hotel. After that the hotel marked me as no show and the take monney in my account as no show fee. That is very very bad and dishonest. Coming from London expected to have a good rest my husband and I were wondering arround to find another place to sleep. I've called booking. Com and they told me that when they try to call the hotel, they send email they don't respond.
Please dear customer just Run away from this hotel. They truth is the book 2 times the same room they won money 2 times  for the same room , what is criminal I will rate them a big ZERO and will also report every thing to groupe Accor"
"Rue Jean Moulin, 95470 Saint-Witz, France",B&B HOTEL Saint-Witz,We came here at midnight and were able to quickly book a room at the console. The room itself was clean and above average in size. In the morning an entire breakfast was set up for us although it seemed we were the only ones eating at that time. Good hotel to spend the night before heading to Asterix park in the morning.
"Rue Jean Moulin, 95470 Saint-Witz, France",B&B HOTEL Saint-Witz,"We had to use the check-in machine as we arrived late (22:30h). By entering your booking number you get  a room code and can use it to access the room.
Equipment very appropriate for the class.
The room was clean and comfortable - perfect for our family of 4.
I can definitely recommend it.

Equipment very appropriate for the class.
Everything was neat and clean.  Especially the AC  is very good on hot days.

"Rue Jean Moulin, 95470 Saint-Witz, France",B&B HOTEL Saint-Witz,"We were friendly greeted and the host was Able to switch to English as our French was ok but not that good.
In the reservation I asked for a babybed, at Arrival the hotelier said that there wasn't much room to put the bed. In the room we Saw that there was a lot of Space under the stairs which was great. The babybed we had gotten was defect, the holetier Saw this immediately and we got another.

In overall the room was good, there was an questionable Brown stain on the toilet door, we cleaned of ourself.

The breakfast was very good, however the room was a bit Small, we were just in time as several people had to wait to have a Table."

"12 All. du Plateau 8 √Ä, 93250 Villemomble, France",hotelF1 Villemomble,"Stayed here on a Saturday in August. Sayed in shared room of 6. Easy to get to, easy sign in after 9pm, room very clean, comfy bed, no issues with noise, facilities as clean as they could be. Really cheap for six people. Would highly recommend and would definitely stay again if in Paris."
"12 All. du Plateau 8 √Ä, 93250 Villemomble, France",hotelF1 Villemomble,"You have to set your expiration before you make the booking. This is a budget hotel, no air conditioning, sharing toilet and bathroom outside the room.

The room is very hot and you have to cover the bedsheets yourself."
"12 All. du Plateau 8 √Ä, 93250 Villemomble, France",hotelF1 Villemomble,"Being one of the best prices in Paris, the rooms are very clean. These were the too two factors. The staff was kind. What more could we ask for at that price."
"12 All. du Plateau 8 √Ä, 93250 Villemomble, France",hotelF1 Villemomble,It's OK on a budget but wouldn't stay there in spring or summer. Rooms have no A/C or fans that work and can become quite hot and uncomfortable
"12 All. du Plateau 8 √Ä, 93250 Villemomble, France",hotelF1 Villemomble,"Cheap. ‚Ç¨40 for a room near Paris on a Saturday night. Keep your expectations in check.

Pros - clean room, working heater, plenty of power sockets, good Wi-Fi.

Cons - Shared toilets & showers, no towels provided, noisy (bring ear plugs)."
"Zac Du Petit Marais, 3 Rue des Am√©riques, 94370 Sucy-en-Brie, France",ibis budget Sucy-en-Brie,"A generally bad hotel. There was no air conditioning in the room, and when we opened the window, we couldn't sleep due to mosquitoes. The walls were covered in squashed mosquitoes, hygiene-wise, it was already bad.

"Zac Du Petit Marais, 3 Rue des Am√©riques, 94370 Sucy-en-Brie, France",ibis budget Sucy-en-Brie,"The worst hotel that I ever been. rooms smell of cigarettes, the plastic bathroom has a bad smell and is not clean.  the furniture is all old.  15 minutes from the RER station, but it takes 30-40 minutes to reach central Paris.

The air condition wasn't working! Even if it hasn't been that hot, with all the noise from the road outside it's impossible to sleep without closing the windows. Even then, you can still hear the construction noise, trains, coaches and road traffic. The bathtub and sink were both clotted. Breakfast was very basic. The receptionist could at least turn off his phone call while checking us in. Overall, please find another hotel as this one will ruin your vacation.

I honestly thought Ibis hotels maintained a certain level of service but that's certainly not true anymore.

Room service was great but that's not enough to make up for this atrocious hotel."

Not even eggs. Poorest in all way. And to make it more worse horrible rude staff. Specially the lady staff in the Reception is very Awfull & rude. I wonder how she secured this Job.

"335 Rue de la Belle √âtoile Zac Paris Nord 2, 95700 Roissy-en-France, France",ibis budget Roissy-CDG Paris Nord 2,"This place is worth it if you only want a place to sleep before going to the airport. There's a shuttle (which you have to pay in advance! We didn't know that) that takes you from and to the airport every 30 mins or so.

We used it because we had an 11hr overnight layover in PAR, and it was kind of ok for that. We do wonder if it would have been better to just use one of the hotels that are within the airport. even if they were more expensive.

Otherwise, the *budget* part is very real. The rooms are tiny (although maybe ok for Paris standards) with an uncomfortable bed, breakfast was terrible (for example, there were no clean plates, people were using napkins and bowls), and the reception was pretty slow with a big line that took almost half an hour to go through before we could check in.

We will probably not stay here again."

The following is from my experience staying at H√¥tel du Parc Aulnay, and is my honest held opinion:

During my stay on the second night I noticed personal belongings were missing from my room. I approached reception about the issue and was told, after 30 minutes of back and forth, that the items were in a trash bag. I demanded for them to be returned to me. An hour or two later, I received my belongings along with a verbal apology from the receptionist (I am happy with this outcome).

On the third night, my last night of the stay, the same items were missing from my room. I approached reception, quite upset about the issue. The receptionist called his boss (different to the receptionist on the first night), and the boss repeatedly hung up on me, and refused to tell me where my items were, or how to get them back.

I have had my belongings stolen from me, twice, and I am now unable to get them back the second time. Oh and the rooms and bed and stuff are good enough."

I was given a small electric heater instead and that did not help, the room was freezing.

The next day, I said I want to leave and to refund the 2nd-night stay, I was told I will be given a different room. Went in and had the exact same problem... Nobody is willing to help and refused the refund.
In the end, I just left the place and went to hotel B&B which was 100 times better and cheaper.. Yes I lost the 2nd night stay but there was no other options.

The area surrounding the hotel felt safe. The reception desk was helpful and when we visited spoke good english.

Entry to the room is by a 6 digit code. The room was small (as expected for the price) But it was okay and clean. The bathroom was okay aswel. (we did take a quick peak in the common bathroom down the hallway, that one looked okay aswel)

The bed was okay (a bit hard but i like it). We also had free wifi during our stay.
The only things i found lacking was a bit more sound isolation from the hallway, other doors closing or opening can be heard really well (this was also a problem with some of the ibis hotels we visited). Also there was no additional lock on the hotel door something i would have used if it were there.

overall we were pleasantly surprised by the price/ quality of the f1 hotel and would definetly go again if all we need is a room for the night."
"7 All. des Carri√®res, 77090 Coll√©gien, France",hotelF1 Marne-la-Vall√©e Coll√©gien,"Bed bugs in the hotel! Our little son had rash because of these bugs.

Hotel did not refund the second night which we - of course - cancelled."

"7 All. des Carri√®res, 77090 Coll√©gien, France",hotelF1 Marne-la-Vall√©e Coll√©gien,"I was sold a room
With a double bed for me and my partner and single beds for the kids.
When we arrive, we had 2 sets of triple bunk beds. The guy at the desk said that they had recently refurbed the hotel and hadn't updates the system yet. I should have been made aware of this at booking.
I would have found another place with suitable sleeping arrangements.

The shower and toilet facilities were vile‚Äîmould on the shower floors and wee in the seats. It was disgusting and not monitored at all.

The entire place smelt of cigarettes
Because they allow
People.To Smoke between the entrance doors.
Smoking in the establishment was not mentioned in the description either. Again, I would have picked another hotel.

I can not for the life of me get into contact with a customer service representatives so will have to go through other channels."

"10 Rue de la Belle Borne, 93290 Tremblay-en-France, France",easyHotel Paris Charles de Gaulle Villepinte,"Real good considering the price you pay. Rooms are cosy and well thought out, bathrooms are nice and clean, everything is new, and it has air conditioning.
There is a shopping center right next to it, and their food places work late into the night, so you can get some food untill like midnight.
The center of Paris is rather far tho, but the public transport is so good it's really not a problem :)
All in all great holiday staying there :)"
"10 Rue de la Belle Borne, 93290 Tremblay-en-France, France",easyHotel Paris Charles de Gaulle Villepinte,"There is nothing ""easy"" about checking in at this place. After traveling for 7 hours that day we wanted nothing more but to kick our feet up. The problem is the incompetent employee couldn't figure out how to look up our reservation. So we had to stand there for over 30 minutes until she eventually asked for someone. Then after all that you would think throwing in a complimentary breakfast or something would be nice but nope nothing. This place charges for everything extra. They then try to sell you breakfast but there's actually an entire supermarket and mall right out front the mall isn't super cheap but there's a lot of options."
"10 Rue de la Belle Borne, 93290 Tremblay-en-France, France",easyHotel Paris Charles de Gaulle Villepinte,"No frills, efficient, comfy and clean.

Loved the wild flowers too.

"10 Rue de la Belle Borne, 93290 Tremblay-en-France, France",easyHotel Paris Charles de Gaulle Villepinte,"Very good location if only for the huge shopping centre with excellent restaurants next door.
The young man at check-in (Sun pm 13 Aug) was perfectly friendly and very hospitable with a natural affinity for guests - an asset to the company.
My only small gripe is a lack of kettle and cups in the room. And the TV remote doesn't seem to have up/down buttons required for a pathological channel surfer such as I."
"10 Rue de la Belle Borne, 93290 Tremblay-en-France, France",easyHotel Paris Charles de Gaulle Villepinte,"Brand new hotel which is very close to the airport, only 10 minutes away. The hotel has receptionist 24/7, where you can check in and out any time of the day.  There is no way to contact the hotel directly. I saw the receptionist hanging up on every phone call they receive. The room was ok and we had the family room with 3 beds. The bathroom and rooms are brand new. The hotel is frequented by young people visiting France. There is a filtered water dispenser for free. If you have a bottle, they charge .50 for an empty bottle if you don't have a bottle, car parking costs 12 euros for a day, and it is very safe. They only accept credit cards, and no cash is accepted at the hotel. Remember, this is not the Hilton. Not easy to find the hotel and the car parking is in the back. You have to drive around the hotel to park. Thank you, management for having a close by hotel to the airport with a decent price."
"1 Rue L√©onard de Vinci, 93600 Aulnay-sous-Bois, France",B&B HOTEL Paris Nord Aulnay-sous-Bois,"The hotel is very okay, just the location that's not clear for uber drivers and I didn't feel very safe in the neighborhood. The price is good and the room itself is good. The wifi is not good since you have to connect and subscribe every time you get in the hotel. There's a bus station near by that you can get a bus to the train station and then you can go to Paris. Since I was working in Parc des Exposicion it was good to go by uber and not so easy to go to the salon."
"1 Rue L√©onard de Vinci, 93600 Aulnay-sous-Bois, France",B&B HOTEL Paris Nord Aulnay-sous-Bois,It is a clean place. Good for spending night or two. We like it. It was quite and clean. It has a good dine out place just on walking distance. Good Bed and Bath.
"1 Rue L√©onard de Vinci, 93600 Aulnay-sous-Bois, France",B&B HOTEL Paris Nord Aulnay-sous-Bois,"We enjoyed out stay at B&B Hotel Aulnay-Sous-Bois; I have used the brand before so I knew I wouldn't be disappointed.

Our taxi from the airport was reasonable and check in was straightforward; we arrived quite late but the receptionist was patient, polite and showed us where our room was.

Overall, the room was adequate and we particularly enjoyed the air conditioning; for the price, so close to Paris, we couldn't complain.

My main disappointment was, although it was possible to get into the centre of Paris from the hotel, it was not as easy as I expected or as the hotel's marketing suggested; there was not a direct train from or to Aulnay-Sous-Bois station, really; these are the airport trains, which are very expensive.

I would recommend the hotel, however - we had a comfortable stay for two nights and it was very good value for money."

Firstly the walls are paper thin and the hallways and our room absolutely stunk of cigarettes after the cleaning lady came to make our beds. beds which had large BROWN stains on 2/3 (too scared to even check the last.) they are rock hard and the pillows weren‚Äôt even pillows but lumpy cushions so try bring your own. there was no quilt, instead a thin sheet.

there was no light in the tiny room??? we had four lamps stuck next to our beds.
we had bugs in our room also.

The bathrooms are a hunk of pink plastic in the corner of the rooms and are the size of an airplane toilet or not even that. Toilet is fine but just REALLY loud and we all didn‚Äôt want to use the shower with mould growing in it. Hairs and something sticky in the
sink. impression made that the bathroom hadn‚Äôt been cleaned in a while since there was hairs on the floor.

breakfast was fine but nothing special as expected.
understandable that it is a budget hotel but the place was dirty and smelly as well as ugly"

We had already paid in full and it seemed that no politeness was deemed necessary. The students were told to stay in their rooms and not sit in the only communal space- the dining room at any time. One night I was awakened by a manger complaining about noise- yet none of us were making any as we were all asleep! In fact, he woke us up! The next evening the police were on site. The rooms were clean, but so small as they had squeezed a bunk above the twin beds, there was no room to put bags really and the bathroom was very small. The local shops were useful though and there was a lovely local Creperie who were so lovely and kind it really cheered us up!"

"14 Rue Amp√®re, 95500 Gonesse, France",Kyriad Direct Le Bourget - Gonesse,"Extremely expensive during Paris Airshow period. Considering the ‚Ç¨200 per night the fact that the air conditioning was broken in several rooms (our party had 6 rooms, 3 of which had broken A/C units) was unacceptable. With daytime temperatures up to 37¬∞C the rooms were like an oven in the evening. No real priority was given to fixing this. Breakfast buffet is also fairly limited. Outside of the show period this might be a reasonable option for budget travelers, with an appropriate price it could be an OK motel style option."

"2 Rue Jean Moulin, 95470 Saint-Witz, France",H√¥tel Restaurant Campanile Saint Witz,"The hotel was chosen due to a convenient location to get the airport and also towards the motorway to Calais.
When we arrived, it was rather late and it was hard to say much about surrounding area rather than proximity of fast food places and maybe some shops.
The room was on the third floor, which was a bit painful with pushing the luggage up the stairs. Maybe there was an elevator, but we didn‚Äôt notice it and went up the stairs.
The room was tiny for the three of us, with a window in the ceiling, which made it look even smaller.
It was okay it terms of cleanliness.

Overall, nothing special and okayish value for the money.

I guess it is okay for one night stay, but I wouldn‚Äôt consider staying there for longer."
"2 Rue Jean Moulin, 95470 Saint-Witz, France",H√¥tel Restaurant Campanile Saint Witz,Had a problem with the room (sheet torn and no kettle) but was all fixed when reported to reception.

Under the main bed (since I was forced to look for the child bed) it is dirty.. cigarette buts etc

Outside they have a very filthy pond for ducks. It smells from quite a distance.

The rooms did smell like cigarette smoke and the cot we were given and had to assemble was broken (and we weren‚Äôt given any bedding for it) meaning we had to have our 3 month old in our bed. Breakfast was better than expected tho.
"30 Av. de la Division Leclerc, 94260 Fresnes, France",IBIS BUDGET FRESNES,"Absolutely shocking!!!  got placed in this hell hole by Easyjet after they cancelled our flight back to the Bristol yesterday. The place was filthy and stank of cigarette smoke, I was unable to sleep at all due to the fact I wouldn't get into the bed so sat up in a chair all night. Could not wait to get out of the place couldn't even bring myself to have a shower and brush my teeth there, as there was to put it politely what looked to be human bodily fluids dried onto the tiles of the shower, waited until I got to the airport at least their bathrooms are clean! The hallway carpets looked like they hadn't seen a hoover since last Christmas and ironically there was a hoover at the end of the hallway! You couldn't make this up, Couldn't tell you what the breakfast was like as I didn't fancy a touch of food poisoning. Stay well away if you like cleanliness, knock yourself out if you like a smelly dirty pit."

The room was clean. Includes towels and soap. Breakfast was good, mainly pieces of cheese, ham, fruits, bread and some delicious croissants. When er first arrived the aisles and room smelled but that reside after 1 day or 2, I think the humidity was causing that. The hotel is located on a shadow neighborhood, the walk to the train station is very isolated."

The room is decent, clean with a small TV in a corner. The showers and WC are shared (at least for the ""Side car"" type of rooms) but they are cleaned and generaly they have soap and toilet paper.
You do not have a towel in your room so you either bring it with you or buy one from the entrance (3 euros).

For the two euros that you pay extra for the breakfast you recieve just that, something basic."

I walked in when I got back from getting food and it had someone‚Äôs stuff in it. They could have stolen everything in our room. I‚Äôm worried that they went through our stuff and there is nobody here to sort this issue out. I Will try to attach a picture.

The rudest staff I have ever experienced. We stayed here twice, first tone was fine, the second time we experienced the worst customer service I have ever seen. This was an older gentleman, with grey hair and glasses. We‚Äôve been in France for weeks and have have a lovely time with every French person that we have met. This is not a reflection of French people, it is the reflection of a nasty and rude person. I Hope to not have to deal with him again.

The room is okay, but they forgot our towels. The lights weren‚Äôt working properly.

It‚Äôs a cheap and easy place in one of the worst neibourhoods. Doesn‚Äôt feel safe walking around at night, even too and from the train station is dark and dodgy."

Left early the morning we checkout as we had to catch the ferry that day and realised shortly after that a pair of air pods had been  left in the room in the rush. Contacted the hotel before the actual check out time to ask if they could  be returned and received a very lazy response to say they couldn't be found and the cleaner possibly put them ""in with laundry"".  Not impressed at all.  Staff were zero help trying to get vending machines working that morning  too.  And very noisy late at night with people gathering outside rooms. Wouldn't recommend at all."
"89-93 Av. Paul Vaillant Couturier, 94250 Gentilly, France",JO&JOE Paris Gentilly,"Unaccustomed as I am to staying in hostels with a ""youth"" bent circumstances led me to this little gem. I had a bike and an urgent need to rest and sleep before an early start. This place provided all of the above plus friendly staff, good vibes and convenience.
Although I stayed in a dorm I suspect I was the smelliest resident (800km on a bike can do that) so no complaints from me but I suspect from others.
I won't be staying again - I'm too old for such things.
But I heartily recommend it.
Excellent noughties hip hop all evening too.
Brilliant."

‚Ä¢ Spacious bed spaces with power outlets in each pod
‚Ä¢ Change room and mirrors
‚Ä¢ Clean
‚Ä¢ Age appropriate decoration- good vibes.

Cons:

The rooms are horrendous, dirty and smelly.  Burnt cigarette marks everywhere, the musty smell mixed with cigarette smoke.  Small and unventilated rooms, in the days I was aware of I saw people going to their cars to rest until the night got cooler.  Of all the employees, only one girl stood out.  The rest a bunch of lazy people who don't care about the state of the hotel, allow people to drink water mixed with juice because they don't want to change the juice box, because they're busy smoking on the terrace. Breakfast is absolutely ridiculous,  one of the servants served burnt bread because he was distracted on the terrace and would not send it to the trash. A horrible experience!

As a family of 6, 2 adults 4 kids, we booked 2 rooms because of how many of us there was but they unfortunately didn't put us adjoining and we were on separate floors. The rooms were small. The 3rd bed comes out from the wardrobe in the middle of the two other beds making it hard to fit a travel cot in as well but we managed. Apart from the really small rooms the hotel was nice. Clean and fresh and the staff we met were all really lovely. Easy to park outside and there's a restaurant next door open late too."

There are actually 2 ibis hotels side by side sharing the same reception: budget and normal. The budget isnchraper, with smaller room, but equipped all the same. Staff is friendly, and my room had a view on the Eiffel tower üòã (zoom 100).

"17 Rue le Corbusier, 95190 Goussainville, France",B&B HOTEL Goussainville CDG,"My partner and I are college students and this hotel was perfect for us, especially considering the breakfast buffet was very well priced. The only issues we had were that the design of the shower made it very hard to keep water from leaking out over the edge and the main comforter of the bed very easily clung to materials of darker colors (kind of rough/ gripping). The employees were amicable and understanding."

"11, Rue Marcelin Berthelot, Z.I Du, Rue du Vaulorin, 92160 Antony, France",ibis budget Antony Massy,"It is just typical Ibis budget accommodation. Absolutely perfect for a sleepover as a bonus there is a parking lot where I didn't have to worry about my car but the biggest positive was the staff, who are very willing and were always able to help us with everything. Nothing was a problem for them. The entire hotel was clean, the room was well maintained every day. If you want to go to the center of Paris, you can walk 35 minutes to the Antony RER stop, or about 8 minutes by bus 297 from the Pascal stop (15 minutes' walk from the hotel) - you are in tariff zone 3. A supermarket is a 5-minute walk from the hotel. The whole suburb of Antony is very quiet and quite safe. If you have a car, you can drive to the Antony RER stop to the ""Indigo Centre-Ville"" paid parking lot, where you will pay approx. ‚Ç¨18 per day. We were extremely satisfied with this location and did not mind the thirty-minute drive to the center of Paris at all."
"11, Rue Marcelin Berthelot, Z.I Du, Rue du Vaulorin, 92160 Antony, France",ibis budget Antony Massy,"Atrocious. I want to start off by saying that I have been at another Ibis Budget hotel before in Berlin, and it was far better in terms of standards. When you arrive, you arrive at what feels like an industrial construction site where construction workers are going in and out, and you as a 'customer' are in the background. Very odd. The lobby is dirty and cheap. The room was falling apart. The only good thing about the room is that the bed is made. If it has been washed is another story. The comfort wasn't there as the pillows had no pillow covers, but merely what felt like tissue paper covering them. The panneling is about to fall apart, there is mould in the bathroom and room, and there are, what seem like burn marks, all over the floor. I didn't dare to look under the bed as I was that grossed out. Then there is the fact that the walls are as thin as paper. A conversation can already be too loud for a sleeping neighbour. There are far better places for around the same pricing to stay at in Paris, just wish I had spotted them earlier."

Being an original building keep in mind that there is a spiral staircase with a lot of stairs, no lift and the rooms are not fully sound proof. I would bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper.

We had a balcony that opened out to the city street and a room that made you truly feel the history of Paris. It wasn‚Äôt luxurious, and it wasn‚Äôt extravagant but it was warm and inviting. It was like going home in another country. As Americans we were in a whole new world and this hotel made us feel welcomed.

There is also desktop semafoon next of the door ( or you can call) incase you need help with the pin code or the entrance, the help desk are very helpful and efficient.

The rooms are tiny, but that was expected as it's a very basic road side hotel meant mainly for overnight stays rather than spending time in the room during the daytime.
There's no smoking now inside , but the rooms smell of cigarette smoke that has stuck to the walls from the past, so this would not be the most pleasent choice of hotel for someone who reacts to that."
"116 Rue des Tiphoines, 91240 Saint-Michel-sur-Orge, France",B&B HOTEL Saint-Michel-Sur-Orge,"Rooms at all are okay. Very negative: The Room Doors are slamming like Hell. You not only hear it, you feel it, that hard are they slamming.
Also negative: Working in the morning on your Room is impossible. The Housekeeping Ladys are very loud on the Hallway and are talking all time over all the Hallway. This should be more professional. They can talk before their Work, in their Break and after Work, but not in that Intensity all over the Hallway. During a Phonecall my Boss at the Phone asked me, if i did sleep in a Trainstation, for that noisy Background."
"116 Rue des Tiphoines, 91240 Saint-Michel-sur-Orge, France",B&B HOTEL Saint-Michel-Sur-Orge,"Chaotic breakfast experience! Breakfast Room to small, chairs couldn't be used as tables where to close to each other.

Run out of cereals, scrambled egg and bread.

Simply becsuse of poor planning! You know the number of guests and should be able to buy enough supplies. Please supply the staff with proper tools to plan according to expected demand.

Staff did what they could due to circumstances and if it wasn't for them you would have a 1 as overall rating of breakfast"
"2 Rte de Longjumeau, 91380 Chilly-Mazarin, France",ibis budget Chilly-Mazarin Les Champarts,"Normal budget hotel. A little dirty. Tiny bathroom and rooms. However large windows, good ventilation. Constant noise from the planes. But for the cheap price it's the best in the area."
"2 Rte de Longjumeau, 91380 Chilly-Mazarin, France",ibis budget Chilly-Mazarin Les Champarts,"Do not choose this hotel if you don't like airplanes. If you like airplanes, this may be your favorite hotel. Between about 6:30am and 23:00, airplanes approach Orly to land, pass right on top at low height.
It has a free parking lot, sufficiently large but spots itself are small.
The rooms and cleanliness is good.
The service is good.
Breakfast is the minimum in terms of choice, but fresh and clean."
"2 Rte de Longjumeau, 91380 Chilly-Mazarin, France",ibis budget Chilly-Mazarin Les Champarts,"Rooms: Decent for a budget hotel. Rooms are a little small but sufficient when you just come back to crash at the night. The bathrooms and the rooms were clean. Bathrooms had soap, shampoo and small towels.

Staff: The reception staff in both the shifts were very nice and helped us with information about the city. When we couldn't buy coffee from the vending machine due to lack of coins, we could buy it from their breakfast area. Card payment is possible over 7 euros. The cleaning staff is also polite and nice.

Location: There is a gas station across the road and a Express store where we bought croissants in the morning. There are a number of restaurants around.
We could also order in via UberEats

Parking: Sufficient spots at the site. No charges."
"2 Rte de Longjumeau, 91380 Chilly-Mazarin, France",ibis budget Chilly-Mazarin Les Champarts,"Very arrogant staff they have. The receptionist told me I could check out @1pm the next day because I only paid for a night. After paying he said ..no he only meant this night and I was like why??? It‚Äôs only 10hrs I‚Äôll be staying then because I arrived very early in the morning hours.  I asked for my refund and he said no problem he will adjust the time for me and asked when I wanted to check out, I said 5pm and he agreed , not only for him to tell his colleague to throw me out by 1pm saying I should have checked out at 11am. I explained what was agreed with his colleague and told me that his colleague told him I should check out at 11am . He didn‚Äôt agree anything with me!
Can you just imagine? Such lies
They started threatening me they‚Äôll call the police on me. Even the cleaners ! What rubbish
Never staying here again
And I don‚Äôt recommend. Besides the room is improperly ventilated (had to manage since it was late and I was staying a night)"
"2 Rte de Longjumeau, 91380 Chilly-Mazarin, France",ibis budget Chilly-Mazarin Les Champarts,"Overall, it is a decent and functional place to stay for a stopover in a holiday journey, that I would recommend.
If you are sensitive to noise, don‚Äôt forget to bring your earplugs.

Highlights:
- Great location: very close to highway
- Functional bedroom and shower
- Decent breakfast for the price

Not so good:
- Bathroom: the shower curtains don‚Äôt close properly so the bathroom is easily wet
- Noisy: as it‚Äôs located next to Paris-Orly airport, you can hear the airplanes passing just above the hotel in order to land"
